# FileToPhotoEncoder

My little attempt to recreate something like [YouTube Infinite-Storage-Glitch](https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch) myself, just for services that offer compressionless unlimted image storage, like the new Amzon Photos service for Prime customers.

# How to use
Download latest release, unzip, win+r "shell:sendto", then create a link to the DecodeFile.exe and EncodeFile.exe.
Now right click select any file/files and press Encode to convert them to an encoded photo and decode to decode the png to it's original file.

# Please download this photo and decode it, you won't regret it.
